      'Ash has always questioned everything. The Aquarian need to reject convention, to see patterns others miss, to insist on doing things his own way even when the easy path is right there \u2014 this isn\u2019t stubbornness, it\u2019s operating system. He sees connections across disciplines, cultures, and altered states that other people don\u2019t see because they\u2019re not looking from the same angle.',
      'Combined with ADHD, this becomes amplified. The conventional world felt like running incompatible software. School, offices, 9-to-5 routines \u2014 none of it matched the way his brain processed information. It took him twenty years to understand that this wasn\u2019t broken. It was a feature, not a bug. He just needed to find the right operating system.',
