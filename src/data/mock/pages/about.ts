  journey: "I am a global psytrance makeup artist. That's the only way to describe the life I live. I don't just attend festivals; I enhance them. My art is born from the beat, designed to glow under the UV lights of the world's best trance floors. It's a passion that has taken me from the tip of Africa to the clubs of Berlin and the jungles of Thailand.",
  festival: [
    "You'll find me where the bass is deepest. I travel with my UV pigments, ready to transform fellow dancers. It's about synchronicity—being in the right place with the right energy.",
    "My process is intuitive and electric. I see the potential for neon on your skin, how it will look when the lasers hit. It's fast, intense, and deeply connected to the psychedelic experience."
  ],
  berlin: [
    "My year is a global chase of summer and sound. From May to August, I base myself in Berlin, diving deep into the techno capital's club culture.",
    "The darkness of Berlin's clubs is the perfect canvas for my UV work. I create sharper, edgier looks that cut through the strobe lights and industrial atmosphere."
  ],
  uv: [
    "Between August and November, I shift to Thailand. The jungle parties and island festivals call for a wilder, more organic neon palette.",
    "Here, I experiment with tribal UV patterns and bioluminescent designs that mimic the nature around us, glowing intensely under the blacklights of the psytrance stage."
  ],
  mousse: [
    "Cape Town is my origin and my anchor. But the world is my studio. I'm always open to discussing international bookings and creative collaborations.",
    "Whether I'm in South Africa, Europe, or Asia, the mission is the same: to elevate the party through the power of UV color."
  ],
  uvMakeup: [
    "Precision in chaos. That's my specialty. I've mastered ambidextrous application to ensure I can work effectively in the middle of a crowded dancefloor.",
    "This skill allows me to paint complex symmetrical designs and third-eye patterns without you having to leave the immersion of the festival."
  ],
  creative: [
    "I don't just paint faces; I unlock avatars. I focus on eyes and face because that's the center of connection on the dancefloor.",
    "After the transformation, you're not just a spectator; you're part of the visual spectacle of the event. I capture the moment, and we stay connected through the global tribe."
  ],
  future: [
    "Every festival is a new gallery. I'm constantly evolving my techniques, exploring new UV pigments and reactive materials.",
    "I live for this art. If you see the neon-clad artist on the dancefloor, come say hi. Let's create something that glows."
