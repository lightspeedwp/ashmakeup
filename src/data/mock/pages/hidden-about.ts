      'Ash Shaw picked up a UV paintbrush for the first time at a park gathering in Berlin in July 2019. What started as a spontaneous experiment became an obsession, then a practice, then a whole identity. He\u2019s been painting faces at psytrance festivals, techno clubs, and open-airs across Europe, South Africa, and Thailand ever since.',
      'He doesn\u2019t do weddings. He doesn\u2019t do corporate events. He doesn\u2019t do commissions. This is a personal art project \u2014 always has been, always will be. The dancefloor is his gallery, blacklight is his medium, and bass is his muse.',
      'Off the dancefloor, he\u2019s a WordPress developer by day (LightSpeed, since 2003), an ADHD brain that never stops connecting dots, an Aquarian who questions everything, and a cyclist who has pedalled hundreds of kilometres to reach festivals with panniers full of paint.',
      'He\u2019s writing a book called \u201CThis one time on acid\u2026\u201D \u2014 part memoir, part manifesto, part fever dream. He hosts a podcast. He makes videos. And he built this entire website as a creative coding project, because apparently one art form was never going to be enough.',
