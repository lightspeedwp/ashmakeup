        'But this isn\u2019t a party memoir. It\u2019s about what the chaos teaches you. It\u2019s about how an Aquarian crazy soul met with an ADHD neurodiverse brain, how these combined with Lucy to forge the person he is today. It\u2019s never one thing \u2014 usually it\u2019s the culmination of many experiences over a long period that finally crystallise into understanding.',

        'The book explores how psychedelic experiences don\u2019t just show you another reality; they rewire how you process this one. How ADHD isn\u2019t a disorder when your environment finally matches your brain\u2019s operating system. How the festival dancefloor became the classroom where everything made sense.',

        'For years, this combination felt like a curse. Too weird for the normal world, too scattered for the creative one. Then Berlin, then Lucy, then the dancefloor \u2014 and suddenly the wiring wasn\u2019t a bug, it was the feature. The book maps that transformation honestly and without apology.',
