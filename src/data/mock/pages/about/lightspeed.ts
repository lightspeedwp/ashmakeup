Before LightSpeed, he\u2019d already cut his teeth as a bicycle courier at Peddlars, an IT support intern at DuxTel, a sysadmin at City Varsity, Qeo Wireless, and SynthaSite, and a Scrum Master at Media24. The company name \u2014 LightSpeedDevelopment, acronym LSD \u2014 was deliberate. If you know, you know.',
      'The pivot came after BarCamp Cape Town in 2006, where Ash met Dave Duarte, who inspired him to explore WordPress. Within months, Warwick Booth joined as lead developer, and LightSpeed transformed from IT support into a WordPress web development agency. That decision changed everything. The entrepreneurial drive came from his parents\u2019 values: honesty, hard work, dedication, good business ethics, and a good, honest set of morals.',
