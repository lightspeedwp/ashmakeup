      'Ash doesn\u2019t just cycle in Berlin \u2014 he lives on his bike. It\u2019s his primary transport, his meditation, and sometimes his stage. There\u2019s something about the flat, endless Berlin streets that frees the mind. Between G\u00f6rlitzer Park and Tempelhof, between the Spree canal and Tiergarten, ideas form with every pedal stroke.',
      'The guy cycling around covered in fairy lights became a recognisable figure at Berlin open-airs before the UV art even started. The bike was always part of the identity \u2014 the art just gave it a purpose beyond transport.',
      'For an ADHD brain, daily cycling is non-negotiable medicine. The rhythm of pedalling, the sensory input of the city, the physical exertion that burns off excess energy \u2014 it\u2019s the most effective daily regulation Ash has found. Berlin summer means painting faces at open-airs until 3am, then cycling home through warm streets that smell of linden trees.',

    { id: 'festival-pilgrimage', title: 'The festival pilgrimage', paragraphs: [
      'When Ash cycles to a festival, the journey becomes part of the art. Hundreds of kilometres of road dissolve the noise of everyday life. By the time he arrives, he\u2019s present, clear, and creatively charged. It\u2019s a pilgrimage in the literal sense \u2014 a journey that prepares the traveller for what\u2019s ahead.',
      'The Origin Festival pilgrimage is the centrepiece. Every year around his birthday, Ash loads a touring bike with 40kg of UV paints, brushes, mirror stand, and camping gear, and cycles from Woodstock, Cape Town, through Sir Lowry\u2019s Pass and Houwhoek Pass to Elandskloof Guest Farm in Helderstroom. The ride is as important as the festival.',
      'He\u2019s also cycled to festivals across Germany, Czech Republic, and Austria \u2014 arriving at festival gates with panniers full of UV paint and a heart full of road-earned stories. In Thailand, he\u2019s logged over 7,000\u202Fkm touring by bicycle, including the Bangkok\u2013Chiang Rai\u2013Chiang Mai festival route. People at festivals don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to ride home \u2014 until they see him pedalling out on the Monday morning. The less you carry, the further you go. But the UV paints always make the cut.',

    { id: 'racing-roots', title: 'Racing roots', paragraphs: [
      'This isn\u2019t a hipster cycling habit. It\u2019s a lifelong relationship with two wheels that started at age thirteen. By 1995, Ash was racing provincial mountain bike events. By 1997, he had Western Province cross-country mountain bike colours \u2014 finishing 3rd overall. In 1998, he was 1st overall: Western Province champion.',
      'At Daemelin College in 1999, he studied marketing while training for the Western Province and South African mountain bike championships. The same year he discovered psytrance at Vortex. Two parallel universes \u2014 competitive sport and festival culture \u2014 that would eventually merge into the cycling-to-festivals identity.',
      'The competitive racing faded, but the engine it built never did. The endurance, the comfort with suffering, the ability to push through when the body says stop \u2014 all of it transferred directly into loaded touring bikes, 300km pilgrimages, and multi-day festival endurance.',

    { id: 'what-road-teaches', title: 'What the road teaches you', paragraphs: [
      'A bicycle strips everything to essentials. You carry only what matters. You move at a speed that lets the landscape actually register. You arrive exhausted, present, and unable to pretend to be anything other than what you are. There\u2019s no hiding on a bike at kilometre 200.',
      'The loaded touring bike is a metaphor for Ash\u2019s entire philosophy: portability isn\u2019t a limitation \u2014 it\u2019s a design constraint that forces creative efficiency. Everything an artist needs, on two wheels. The same principle drives the UV art (minimal tools, maximum impact) and the business (lean team, maximum output).',
      'Every ride has a meditative quality. The repetitive motion, the breath, the gradual unspooling of thoughts. By the time Ash arrives at a festival after 150\u202Fkm of riding, he\u2019s processed everything the conscious mind was holding. The creative work that follows is cleaner, more instinctive, more honest. The road is the warm-up for the art.',
      'Hard-won wisdom from the road: in Thailand\u2019s humidity, keep daily distances between 80 and 120\u202Fkm. Not even chamois cream protects from saddle sores if you push past 150\u202Fkm a day \u2014 the Hua Hin to Phuket ride (900\u202Fkm in six days) left lasting scars. And always have a packing checklist. Even with a checklist, he leaves stuff behind \u2014 so every festival, the checklist gets adapted, duplicated, and customised again.',
