    question: "Does Ash collaborate with festivals?",
    answer: "Absolutely! While his roots are in spontaneous dancefloor artistry, he loves connecting with festival organisers and fellow artists. If you'd like him to bring his neon energy to your event, reach out through the contact page."
  },
  {
    id: 'style',
    question: "What is Ash's signature style?",

    id: 'speed',

  },
  {
    id: 'process',
    question: "How does the spontaneous process work?",
    answer: "If you see him on the dancefloor with his kit, just ask! He intuitively analyses your features and chooses complementary neon colours to make you glow. All he asks for in return is a smile and a photo to capture the memory."
  },
  {
    id: 'products',
    question: "What products does he use?",
    answer: "He uses professional-grade, skin-safe UV reactive paints and pigments that are designed to last through sweat and dancing. His kit is curated for high-impact glow and durability in tropical and club environments."

    id: 'location',
    question: "Where can you find Ash?",
    answer: "He follows the sun and the sound. He's based in Berlin for the techno season and travels internationally for psytrance festivals. Check his social media to see where he is right now!"
