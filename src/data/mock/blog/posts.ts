# Origin Festival 2026: A Psytrance Cycle Odyssey

For me, the pilgrimage to a psytrance festival is as important as the event itself. This year, for my birthday, I decided to cycle 300km from my home in Woodstock, Cape Town, to Origin Festival and back.

It wasn't just a ride; it was a meditation. A way to cleanse the mind before entering the psychedelic playground.

I watched a beautiful sunset over Elgin, feeling the anticipation building. The energy of the coming gathering was palpable even from kilometers away.

## The Journey Begins

Today's ride to Grabouw via Sir Lowry's pass was 80km of pure adrenaline. I crushed that pass and felt on top of the world. Tomorrow, I celebrate my birthday in style, cycling the final 75km to Origin Festival in Helderstroom. Can't wait for a weekend of stomping, UV vibes, and reuniting with my trance family.

## Festival Magic

I arrived at the party around 11:30 AM on Friday morning, buzzing with endorphins. I skipped the queue, shouted that it was my birthday, and the welcome was overwhelming!

Origin Festival is a staple of the Cape Town psytrance calendar. Thanks to Monique and Reagan for curating such an incredible space—the psychedelic decor, the thumping basslines, and the beautiful souls on the dancefloor were perfection.

I spent the weekend doing what I love most: painting faces in the shade during the day and watching them glow under the UV cannons at night. To my friends, thanks for making me feel so loved. It was a truly magnificent experience.

## The Return Journey

I cycled back to the farm in Elgin on Monday to decompress, and then finally all the way back to Cape Town on Tuesday.

Just conquered the road back to Cape Town after an unforgettable birthday ride. Completed just short of 300km with a 40kg bike pack, 3200m climbing, 14hrs of pure adrenaline and top speed of over 75km/hr.

Time to dive back into work focus and training for the next adventure. The beat goes on! One love & peace out 💚❤️🌈

# Twenty-three years of LightSpeed

LightSpeedDevelopment — LSD — was founded in January 2003. I was twenty-two years old. The acronym was intentional. The company wasn't born from a business plan; it was born from a fundamental need for autonomy.

You never know if you're ready to start a business, but I knew that I didn't want to work at City Varsity for another year. I've always been entrepreneurial, but I really didn't like working for an employer. I have my own ideas and things that drive me. Throughout my whole life, I've designed my life the way I want to live it.

## The pivot that changed everything

In 2006, I attended BarCamp Cape Town. It was an unconference — no preset agenda, no keynote speakers, no hierarchy. Dave Duarte gave an impassioned talk about this open-source CMS called WordPress and why it was going to change the web.

Something clicked. Not just the technology — the philosophy. Open source. Community-driven. Transparent. Accessible. These were the same values my parents had instilled.

The people at that BarCamp didn't just introduce me to WordPress — they introduced me to a way of working and building that would define the next two decades.

## The right people change everything

Warwick Booth joined in December 2006. He has been by my side for nearly two decades. The first truly right person.

Barbara Kerr joined in 2010 and became a partner soon after. She took on the roles of COO, CFO, and HR — all the operational roles that my ADHD brain struggles with. Barbara's contribution to LightSpeed cannot be overstated.

In 2025, we advertised for new developers on LinkedIn and received 450 applicants. We expressly did NOT want Elementor or page builder developers. We wanted people with a will to learn. Out of 450, only 2 made it to interview. Those interns are now levelling up faster than anyone I've ever seen.

## Freedom requires structure

The freedom given to the LightSpeed team mirrors the freedom I demand for myself. ADHD brains need structure to function, so I build meticulous systems — GitHub workflows, daily planning templates, curriculum structures — that keep the chaos productive.

The team is levelling up week on week at a rate never seen before in my career. Yes, this is because of AI — GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Model Context Protocol — but without a team that has the drive to learn, progress, and grow, this would not happen.

## What twenty-three years teaches you

**The business feeds the art, the art feeds the business.** The same brain that builds WordPress design systems is the brain that designs neon faces at 3am on a dancefloor. LightSpeed has run profitably for twenty-three years because the entrepreneurial drive and the creative drive are the same thing.

**ADHD is an engine, not a handicap.** The hyperfocus. The pattern recognition. The need to build systems to manage the chaos. The ability to context-switch between design, code, client strategy, and team management. These are features, not bugs.

**Autonomy is non-negotiable.** Happy team, better work, better company. The company is the container that makes the rest possible — the Berlin summers, the Thailand bootcamps, the festival circuits, the art.

Twenty-three years is more than half my life. The lessons compound over decades. Here's to the next chapter.

    content: `
# The tribes that made me

We are the sum of our tribes. Not the families we're born into, but the communities we choose — the ones that recognise us before we recognise ourselves.

After forty-five years on this planet, I've realised that the magic happens in the overlap. The WordPress developer who DJs psytrance sets. The trail runner who paints UV faces at festivals. The Berlin club kid who runs a profitable agency from a laptop.

These tribes aren't separate identities — they're overlapping frequencies that, when combined, create something richer than any single one.

## The psytrance dancefloor (1999–present)

The first tribe. The dancefloor family that taught me what it means to lose yourself and find yourself in the same breath. From Vortex 1999 to festivals across four continents, the psytrance scene is where I learned to dance, to connect, to create.

Rolling basslines, UV lights, and a shared understanding that the dancefloor is a portal to something larger. The tribe that gave me my first costume, my first festival family, and eventually, my art form.

## The WordPress community (2006–present)

BarCamp Cape Town 2006 was the gateway. Twenty years of WordCamps across four continents. The Theme Review Team. The late-night discussions about design systems and block themes.

This is the tribe that taught me radical transparency, knowledge-sharing, and the power of building in public. The professional tribe that proved business and community don't have to be opposites.

## Berlin club scene (2019–present)

The laboratory. Sisyphos. Griessmühle (RIP). About Blank. The warehouses and basements where techno is religion and the door policy is a filter for energy, not status.

The Berlin club scene taught me that freedom isn't chaos — it's structure with the rules stripped away. The tribe of neurodivergent creatives, DJs, visual artists, fire dancers, and festival freaks who understand that creativity isn't a career; it's a way of being.

## The endurance tribes

**Trail running:** The mountain people. Table Mountain, Lion's Head, trails through fynbos and granite. Early morning starts, vertical climbs, the camaraderie at the summit.

**Mountain biking:** From racing days representing Western Province (1997–1999) to bike packing across continents. 7,000+ kilometres across Thailand. The 300-kilometre birthday ride to Origin Festival. The bike is the vehicle. The road is the teacher.

**Triathlon & Muay Thai:** The multi-discipline warriors. Swim, bike, run. Pad work, bag work, clinching. Your body is your primary tool. Discipline and freedom are not opposites.

## The overlap is the identity

No single tribe defines me. The intersection of all of them does.

The psytrance dancefloor taught me to move. The WordPress community taught me to build. The Berlin scene taught me to be unapologetically myself. The endurance sports taught me discipline. The mountain taught me humility. The bicycle taught me freedom.

The overlap is the identity. We are the sum of our tribes. And these are mine.

    excerpt: 'Nearly twenty years of green fingers. May 2019 marked the launch of Six Cats Cannabis Club — a garden, a philosophy, and six resident felines.',

# Six Cats: the green garden begins

I've always had green fingers. Long before Six Cats had a name or a website or a grading system, there was a garden in Cape Town and a quiet, patient relationship with growing that had been building for nearly two decades.

Cannabis cultivation is an art form that rewards exactly the qualities I have in abundance: meticulousness, patience, obsessive attention to detail, and a genuine respect for the natural process.

## May 2019: the club is born

In May 2019, that passion became a club. Six Cats Cannabis Club — named, naturally, for the cats. The first cats were adopted in 2003, a brother and sister called Bart and Lisa. They quickly became the mascots for the yearly harvest.

Over the years, nine homeless cats found their way to us. Some have left. The ones who remain are the soul of the operation: Timmy (the resident therapy cat), Wendy (the agile matriarch), Jimmy (the FIV fighter), Bean (the survivor), Jeff (the wanderer), and Frank (blue eyes).

## The cultivation philosophy

Entirely organic: living soil built from Bokashi composting and worm farming. Rainwater harvested and triple-filtered (Cape Town almost ran out of water in 2018 — we take water seriously). Companion planting with basil. Worm compost tea brewed every two weeks throughout the growing season.

Nothing rushed. Nothing synthetic. Small-batch, hand-tended, high-quality flower grown outdoors using the natural cycles of the sun and seasons.

## The eight values

Every harvest season, these eight values guide the operation:

1. **Authenticity** — We grow what we say we grow. No relabelling, no exaggeration, no pretence.
2. **Consciousness** — Every decision considers impact: on the soil, on the water table, on the neighbourhood.
3. **Consistency** — Same soil, same methods, same care, every season.
4. **Experience** — Nearly twenty years of growing informs every decision.
5. **Meticulousness** — Every plant is observed daily. The notebook is sacred.
6. **Sustainability** — Rainwater harvesting. Bokashi composting. Worm farming. Glass packaging returned and reused.
7. **Passion** — This is not a side hustle. This is a practice, a meditation.
8. **Quality** — The grading system exists because quality is measurable.

## The grading system

- **Quads (AAAA):** Top-shelf. Dense, trichome-covered, exceptional terpene profile.
- **Trips (AAA):** Excellent quality. Flavour and effect are outstanding.
- **Doubles (AA):** Good, solid flower. The everyday option.
- **Singles (A) / Budget Blend:** Smaller buds, still grown with the same care.

## What Six Cats means to me

Six Cats is the outlet for what I call my green fingers — the deeply satisfying practice of growing something from seed to harvest. These are the same hands that paint neon faces at festivals. Both practices require the same qualities: patience, attention to detail, sensitivity to the subject, and a deep respect for the process.

What started as one man's garden has become a club, a community, and a philosophy. The eight values aren't just about cannabis — they're about how I approach everything.

Six Cats is not a side project. It's a mirror.

    content: `
# Berlin called, I answered

Berlin called to me not through brochures or travel blogs, but through stories whispered at afterparties and painted across the faces of returning festival friends. I discovered it in 2019 — just before the world stopped — arriving with a bicycle and the instinct that this city was going to mean something.

What I found was a city that doesn't just tolerate difference — it demands it.

## The UV paint discovery (July 2019)

It happened in a warehouse. I can't remember which one — they all blur together in the best possible way. Someone had UV paints. Someone asked if I could paint their face. I had never touched a paintbrush for makeup before.

I said yes.

Twenty years of standing out in costumes — from the yellow suit at Vortex 1999 to the Cow Man era to the various themed outfits — had been unconscious preparation for this moment. I understood visibility. I understood energy. I understood how to read a crowd and match the vibe.

The paintbrush was just the tool I'd been missing.

## Freedom to be weird

Berlin gave me three things no other city could:

**Freedom to be weird** — not just tolerated but expected. A city where cycling to a club in fairy lights with a box of UV paints is completely unremarkable.

**Affordable creative space** — compared to London, Paris, or San Francisco, Berlin let a young South African build a life without the crushing overhead that kills creativity.

**The right scene** — techno and psytrance communities that overlap, collaborate, and welcome outsiders.

## The tribe of misfits

I didn't just find a community in Berlin — I found my species. DJs, visual artists, fire dancers, sound engineers, fellow festival freaks who understand that creativity isn't a career; it's a way of being.

The community is specifically neurodivergent creatives who look out for each other, share studio space, and collaborate on wild ideas that would make no sense anywhere else. This is the tribe of misfits — the people whose brains run on the same frequency.

## Cycling the city

The flat, endless Berlin streets free the mind. Between Görlitzer Park and Tempelhof, between the Spree canal and Tiergarten, ideas form with every pedal stroke.

Painting faces at open-airs until 3am, cycling home through warm streets that smell of linden trees, and knowing there's another party tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that.

## The art form I'd been searching for

UV paint on skin is the opposite of a costume. It transforms the person themselves. No hiding behind fabric. The art is on you, part of you, inseparable from you.

Twenty years of costumes taught me one thing that made me a better makeup artist: standing out is a skill, and once you've mastered it for yourself, you can teach others to do it.

I don't just paint faces — I give people permission to be the most visible person on the dancefloor. I know what that feels like because I have been doing it since 1999.

Berlin gave me the paintbrush. The dancefloor gave me the canvas. And the art? The art has never stopped flowing.

# Psytrance Survival: 10 Tips for Bulletproof Makeup

Psytrance festivals are extreme environments. We are talking about dust, heat, sweat, and non-stop movement for days. Whether I'm cycling to a gathering in South Africa or dancing in a Thai jungle, one truth remains: **I want to stomp, not touch up my face.**

My "Neon vs Atomic Black" style needs to be crisp. Over the years, I've refined a "survival kit" routine that withstands the intensity of the trance floor.

## 1. Prime Like Your Life Depends On It

When I'm in Thailand, the humidity is 90%. Without a gripping primer, your art will slide off.
*   **For Tropical Climates:** Use sticky, gripping primers.
*   **Pro Tip:** Apply primer to eyelids and even lips. It anchors the neon.

## 2. Waterproof Is Non-Negotiable

If I'm cycling 75km to a festival, I'm sweating.
*   **Liners:** Must be waterproof. No panda eyes on the dancefloor.
*   **Body Paint:** Alcohol-activated paints or theatrical grease paints set with powder are indestructible.
*   **Glitter Glue:** Water-resistant is key for keeping your third eye intact.

## 3. The Sandwich Technique

"Double-setting" is my secret weapon for the Berlin techno bunkers.
1.  **Cream Base:** I work fast with creams.
2.  **Powder Set:** Lock it in.
3.  **Setting Spray:** Drench the face.
4.  **Repeat:** A second layer.

## 4. Embrace the UV

This is where the magic happens.
*   **Vibrant Colors:** Neon pinks, electric blues, acid greens.
*   **Graphic Liner:** Sharp, geometric lines hold up better than messy blending.
*   **Blacklight Check:** Always check your look under a UV torch before heading out.

## 5. Less Is More (Foundation-Wise)

Don't wear a mask. A heavy base cakes in the heat. I prefer spot concealing so the skin can breathe and sweat naturally while the neon design stays sharp.

## 6. Lip Stains Over Lipstick

We are busy dancing! Lip stains dye the skin for color that lasts through water and hydration breaks.

## 7. The "Survival" Kit

I carry my kit in my bike panniers.
*   **Blotting Papers:** For the T-zone.
*   **Mini Setting Spray:** A refreshing spritz cools you down.
*   **Cotton Buds:** For cleaning up edges.

## 8. Hydrate First

Makeup sits better on hydrated skin. A quick wipe and moisturizer makes the paint glide on smoother.

## 9. Strategic Creams

Cream blushes merge with your natural flush from dancing. Just remember to set them!

## 10. Embrace The Imperfection

We are human beings dancing in nature. The best psytrance looks celebrate the wildness. Smudged liner looks grungy and cool. Faded glitter tells the story of a great night.

## Final Thoughts

Psytrance makeup is a ritual. It's about connecting with your tribe. When I stop someone to paint their face, it's a moment of connection. These tips ensure that the art we create together lasts as long as the memory.

Now go out there, paint your face, and find me on the dancefloor! ✨

# Glowing in the Jungle: The Ultimate UV Guide

There is a special kind of magic that happens in Thailand between August and November. The sun goes down, the blacklights flicker on, and the jungle comes alive with glowing creatures.

UV makeup is the core of my identity. Whether I'm at the Jungle Experience in Koh Phangan or a psytrance rave in Cape Town, mastering the art of the glow allows you to become part of the visual frequency of the party.

## What Makes Makeup UV-Reactive?

It's science, baby! UV makeup contains fluorescent pigments that absorb UV light (blacklight) and instantly re-emit it. This is different from "glow-in-the-dark". UV makeup glows *instantly* and *intensely*.

**My Kit Essentials:**
*   Fluorescent pigments (DayGlo styles)
*   Neon colorants
*   Specific UV-reactive compounds

## The Best UV Makeup Products

I've tested everything in the humid Thai heat.
*   **Neon Paradise UV Face Paint:** Water-activated for fast detailed designs.
*   **Mehron Paradise AQ Neon:** Smells like coconut, glows intensely.
*   **Suva Beauty Hydra Liners:** Unmatched for graphic UV liner work.

## Application Techniques for Maximum Glow

### 1. The White Base Rule
Neon colors pop more on a white background. I often lay down a base of white face paint where I plan to put the neon to make it vibrate.

### 2. High Contrast "Atomic Black"
This is my signature: **Neon vs Atomic Black**.
If everything glows, nothing stands out. You need darkness to appreciate the light.
*   I use deep black liner to outline my neon shapes.
*   The black disappears into the darkness, making the floating neon shapes look 3D and holographic.

### 3. Geometric Patterns & Tribal Designs
UV makeup lends itself perfectly to precision.
*   **Dots:** Perfect circles using the back of a brush.
*   **Lines:** Sharp, architectural rays or tribal markings.
*   **Splatter:** Galaxy effects for a cosmic vibe.

## Safety First!

⚠️ **Important:** Not all neon pigments are eye-safe. Always be careful around the immediate eye area and patch test first.

## My Favorite UV Looks

### The Neon Warrior
Bold tribal lines across the cheekbones, a strong stripe down the chin, and dots above the brow. Electric blue and toxic green for a fierce vibe.

### Cosmic Galaxy
Blending purple and blue UV shadows as a base, then splattering white UV paint over the top to create stars.

## Pro Tips for the Night

1.  **Bring a Keyring Light:** A small UV keyring torch helps you check the makeup in the dark.
2.  **Photos:** Turn off the flash! You need the ambient UV light to capture the glow.

## The Final Glow

UV makeup is about play. It's about letting your inner child run wild in the psychedelic playground.

If you see me in Thailand or on a dance floor in Berlin, come find me. I might just have my UV paints with me, ready to make you glow. ✨

# The Nomad's Kit: Essential Festival Packing List

Heading to a festival? The excitement is real, but so is the panic of packing. Do you bring everything "just in case," or travel light?

As someone who cycles to festivals (like my 300km trip to Origin!), space is luxury. Everything needs to fit into my bike panniers. Over years of traveling between Cape Town, Berlin, and Thailand, I've refined the **lightweight, mobile makeup kit**.

## The Foundation Essentials

*   **Tinted Moisturizer:** Tubes are lighter than glass bottles.
*   **High-Coverage Concealer:** A tiny pot goes a long way.
*   **Translucent Setting Powder:** Essential for the sweat.
*   **SPF 50:** Non-negotiable for outdoor parties.

## Eye Makeup Must-Haves

*   **One Versatile Palette:** Slim cardboard packaging saves weight.
*   **Waterproof Eyeliner:** Black and White.
*   **Waterproof Mascara:** Essential.
*   **Glitter + Glitter Glue:** Biodegradable only!
*   **Eye Makeup Stickers:** My secret weapon for instant impact.

## Lips & Cheeks

*   **Lip Stain:** Low maintenance color.
*   **Multistick:** Lips, cheeks, eyes. One product, three uses.

## Tools & Accessories

*   **Dual-Ended Brushes:** Space savers.
*   **Fingers:** The best tools!
*   **Small Mirror:** Don't rely on festival bathrooms.
*   **Headlamp:** Crucial for campsite makeup sessions.

## The "Oh Sh*t" Emergency Kit

*   **Band-aids:** For dancing blisters.
*   **Hand Sanitizer:** Hygiene first.
*   **Eye Drops:** For dust and smoke.
*   **Nail Glue:** Quick fixes.

## Pro Packing Tips

1.  **Waterproof Bag:** Keep your kit dry in a dry bag.
2.  **Decant:** Use contact lens cases for small amounts of product.
3.  **Label:** Festivals get messy.
4.  **Trash Bag:** Leave no trace!

Pack smart, travel light, and see you on the road! 🚴‍♂️✨

# Neon Jungle: My Thailand Festival Season

Thailand. The Land of Smiles. And from August to November, my psychedelic playground.

While Berlin gives me the dark, industrial techno edge, Thailand is where I reconnect with color, nature, and flow. From the Full Moon Parties on Koh Phangan to the deep Jungle Experience, the energy here is pulsating.

## The Tropical Challenge

The first lesson of Thai artistry: humidity takes no prisoners. 90% humidity means sweat starts immediately.

**My Solutions:**
I overhauled my kit. Heavy foundations were out. I focus on "sweat-proof" eye designs using graphic liners and alcohol-activated body paints that stain the skin and move with the sweat.

## Jungle Festival Vibes

There is something primal about partying in the jungle. The aesthetic in Koh Phangan is distinct: glowing, organic, and neon.

*   **UV is King:** The jungle canopy is dark, so UV-reactive paints are essential.
*   **Tropical Palette:** Turquoise like the ocean, coral pinks, and vivid greens.
*   **Natural Skin:** We keep skin fresh and dewy, enhancing tans rather than covering them.

## Cultural Respect

Working in a different culture requires mindfulness. In Thailand, the head is sacred. I always ask permission before touching anyone's face, and respect local customs.

## Favorite Looks from the Season

### The Island Glow
*   **Base:** Ultra-sheer skin tint with illuminator.
*   **Eyes:** Gold or copper shimmer.
*   **Vibe:** "Beach goddess."

### Jungle Warrior
*   **Design:** Sharp, geometric tribal markings in UV Green and Orange.
*   **Eyes:** Blacked out graphic liner.
*   **Vibe:** Fierce and ready to stomp.

### Full Moon Magic
*   **Base:** White face paint patches to boost neon vibrancy.
*   **Design:** Swirling cosmic galaxies.
*   **Vibe:** Ethereal and space-age.

## The Magic of Thai Festival Culture

I love the *Sabai Sabai* (relax, chill) attitude. Everyone is there to connect with nature, the music, and each other.

I've painted faces of people from 50 different countries here, all united by the beat. If you ever get the chance to experience a Thai festival, GO. And let me know—I might just be there with my brushes ready! 🌴✨

# Psychedelic Color Theory: An Intuitive Approach

People often ask me how I decide on a makeup look for a stranger I've just met on a dance floor. I don't have hours. I have seconds.

My process is intuitive, but grounded in **Color Theory**. I look at your skin complexion, your hair, and your eye color, and I instantly see the complementary colors that will make you vibrate.

## The Color Wheel Basics

*   **Primary:** Red, Blue, Yellow.
*   **Secondary:** Orange, Green, Purple.

## My "3-Second" Analysis

1.  **Scan the Eyes:**
    *   **Blue Eyes:** I reach for Oranges, Coppers, and Bronzes (Complementary contrast).
    *   **Green Eyes:** Purples, Reds, or Pinks.
    *   **Brown Eyes:** Vibrant Blues or Turquoise make them pop.

2.  **Scan the Skin Tone:**
    *   **Warm Undertones:** Earth tones, Golds, warm Reds.
    *   **Cool Undertones:** Silvers, Blues, Cool Purples.

## Color Harmonies on the Dance Floor

### 1. Complementary Colors (The "Pop")
Opposites attract. Blue next to Orange creates maximum vibration. Great for high-energy psytrance looks where you want to be seen from a distance.

### 2. Analogous Colors (The "Flow")
Colors that sit next to each other (Blue, Blue-Green, Green). Creates a harmonious, "mermaid" vibe for daytime parties.

### 3. Triadic Colors (The "Bold")
Red, Blue, Yellow. Bold, playful, primary. A statement.

## Temperature: Warm vs. Cool

*   **Warm Colors:** Energetic, sunny. Great for day parties.
*   **Cool Colors:** Mysterious, ethereal. Perfect for Berlin techno bunkers.

## Pro Tips for Practice

1.  **Trust Your Eye:** If it looks good, it IS good.
2.  **Break The Rules:** Clashing colors can look high-fashion and edgy.
3.  **Speed:** Practice making these decisions fast.

Color theory turns makeup from a routine into an art form. It allows me to connect with you instantly and create something that is uniquely *yours*. 🎨

# Sparkle Responsibly: The Eco-Glitter Revolution

I spend my life outdoors. I cycle mountain passes, swim in Thai oceans, and dance in forests. I love nature.

That is why there is one rule in my makeup kit: **No Plastic Glitter.**

Traditional glitter is microplastic. It ends up in the ocean and marine life eats it. Not chic. The good news? **Bioglitter** exists.

## What is Biodegradable Glitter?

True biodegradable glitter is made from plant cellulose, primarily eucalyptus trees.

**Why I Love It:**
*   **Feel:** Softer on the skin.
*   **Shine:** Just as metallic and holographic.
*   **Decomposition:** Breaks down naturally.

## My Favorite Brands

*   **Bioglitter™:** The gold standard.
*   **EcoStardust:** Amazing mixes.
*   **Festival Face:** Great chunky mixes.

## How to Apply & Remove

**Application:**
1.  **Prep:** Apply glitter primer or aloe vera gel.
2.  **Pack:** Pat glitter onto the sticky base.
3.  **Set:** Use setting spray.

**Removal:**
1.  **The Wipe:** Wipe off with a reusable cotton pad.
2.  **The Bin:** Throw bulk glitter in the bin/compost.
3.  **The Wash:** Wash your face. Strays are safe for the drain.

## The Future is Sparkly AND Sustainable

Making the switch to eco-glitter is the easiest way to make your festival experience greener. We can shine without leaving a trace.

Let's protect the playgrounds we love to dance in. 🌍✨

# The Dancefloor Gave Me Everything

The significant relationships in my life share a common thread: they were all forged on the dancefloor, in festival conditions, in moments of shared intensity. Not at dinner parties or through dating apps — on the trance floor, at 3am, in the glow of UV light.

## Where real connections happen

I met Barbara at a December Vortex. Front left speaker. She was older, I was young and wearing the yellow suit. I protected her against someone from my hometown. We connected deeply on the dancefloor immediately — that's the pattern of my life. The dancefloor as the place where real connections happen.

She became one of the most important people in my life. We went through every chapter of the story together. The bus to Zambia sealed it. Barbara is one of my best friends, if not my best friend. We run two businesses together — LightSpeed and Six Cats. We separated amicably, found clear boundaries, and maintained the friendship and partnerships. That's not a failure of relationships. It's the highest possible outcome: love that transforms rather than diminishes.

## Ego is optional. Connection is everything.

The lesson the dancefloor teaches you, if you stay long enough, is that ego is optional. Connection is everything. The most beautiful art happens when you stop trying to be impressive and start trying to be honest.

After twenty-five years my heart now beats for house and techno too — the roots remain, but the dancefloor taught me to follow the energy, not the genre. I'm really particular about music now. I'm a bit over trance so it's got to be really good trance for me to enjoy it. Times change, people change, and you discover new things.

But the dancefloor itself never changes. It's still the place where ADHD brains find their natural operating environment. Where sensory richness replaces the boredom of conventional spaces. Where community forms without the filters of daily life. Where the kid who was bullied for being small can make strangers feel like the most radiant people in the room.

## The golden era

The South African outdoor trance scene in the early 2000s was a golden era. There is no other way to describe it.

Alien Safari was the flagship party series — legendary sound systems set up in the Boland mountains outside Cape Town, the Stellenbosch winelands as backdrop, and a community that treated every gathering as sacred. Vortex was the spiritual calendar: Easter Vortex and December Vortex were the fixed points around which the entire year was organised. You didn't ask "are you going to Vortex?" — you asked "which campsite are you at?"

The Cape Town mountain venues were extraordinary. Dance under the stars with the Table Mountain range visible on the horizon. The Boland backdrop, Western Cape summer, clear skies from October to March. At peak, there were two to four festivals per month. Every weekend was an option. The scene was intimate enough that everyone knew each other but large enough that you could always meet someone new.

The values were real, not performative. Community care — people looked out for each other. Environmental respect — "leave no trace" was enforced by the community itself. Creative freedom — nobody judged your outfit, your dancing, your way of being. The small scene meant genuine relationships, not transactional networking. This was the community that raised me from twenty to thirty, that taught me everything I know about belonging.

## The neurodivergent playground

Here is something I only understood after my ADHD diagnosis at forty: the dancefloor was teaching me to manage my neurology years before I had a name for it.

**Sensory richness replacing boredom.** The ADHD brain craves stimulation — it literally underproduces dopamine, so it seeks environments that provide it. A conventional office, a quiet restaurant, a lecture hall — these are torture chambers for the ADHD brain. A dancefloor at 3am with bass at 140 BPM, UV lights strobing, a hundred bodies moving in synchrony, and the smell of incense and dust? That is the exact stimulation level the ADHD brain needs to feel calm.

**Physical endurance as a focus mechanism.** Dancing for eight, ten, twelve hours straight is not a party trick — it is a regulation strategy. The body in motion anchors the mind. Stop moving, and the thoughts scatter. Keep moving, and everything aligns. This is the same principle behind why I cycle 40 kilometres a day: movement is medication.

**Community as anchor.** The ADHD brain struggles with executive function — planning, organising, following through. But community provides external structure. The festival calendar is the schedule. The friends are the accountability. The dancefloor is the destination. You don't need to plan when the community plans for you.

The evolution from psytrance purist to house and techno appreciation was not betrayal — it was growth. The dancefloor remains sacred. Not as escape from life but as deeper engagement with it. The genre changes, the BPM shifts, the venue evolves. But the fundamental truth is permanent: the dancefloor is where I am most myself.

# The Costume Evolution: From Chicken Man to UV Artist

In the early 2000s, I discovered a love for dancing at festivals and conceptualised the idea of dressing up at parties. The evolution happened in stages, and each stage taught me something about visibility, identity, and the courage to be different.

First, the yellow suit — found at a charity shop, first worn at a festival, earned me the nickname the Chicken Man. This was the beginning of standing out on purpose, of making the dancefloor into a stage. Then the red suit — escalation. If one bold suit works, try another.

Then the white and black cow suit. The pivot to character. No longer just dressed up — now in costume. The brown and beige cow suit cemented it: I became known as the Cow Man for many years. People at festivals STILL ask if I'm the guy who used to dress as the cow man.

## Unconscious training

In the 2000s I was going to two to four festivals a month in Cape Town. Every single Alien Safari. Every single Vortex. This wasn't casual attendance. This was a way of life. The dancefloor was classroom, gallery, church, and community centre.

The psytrance buddies became a staple in life. The scene was small enough to know everyone but big enough to always surprise you. The South African outdoor trance scene in the early 2000s was something magical — wild landscapes, clear stars, proper sound systems, and a community that genuinely cared about each other.

I became very well known at parties because of the unique outfits. But what I didn't understand yet was that the costumes were preparation. Twenty years of standing out on purpose, of being the most visible person on every dancefloor, of reading energy and crowd dynamics — all of it was unconscious training for the moment I'd finally pick up a paintbrush.

## The timeline

The costume timeline tells the story of an identity being built without the owner knowing it.

**1999–2000: The yellow suit.** Chicken Man era. Vortex festivals in the Western Cape mountains, Alien Safari in the Boland hills. A twenty-year-old in a charity-shop suit dancing like nobody was watching — except everyone was. That was the point. The first taste of what it feels like to be the most visible person in the room.

**2001–2003: The red suit.** Escalation era. If one loud suit works, try louder. The red suit said: I am here, I am not apologising, and I am going to dance for twelve hours straight. People started recognising me between festivals. "You're the suit guy." Identity was forming.

**2003–2006: The white and black cow suit.** Character pivot. This wasn't just dressing up any more — this was becoming a character. The cow suit had a narrative. People didn't just notice me; they remembered me. They told stories about me to friends who hadn't been there.

**2006–2010: The brown and beige cow suit.** "The Cow Man" identity fully cemented. At every festival, without fail, someone would shout across the dancefloor: "It's the Cow Man!" Years later, people at festivals would approach me: "Are you the guy who used to dress as a cow?" The recognition moments accumulated into something bigger than a costume — they became proof that standing out is a practice, not a talent.

**2010–2018: Various themed outfits.** The evolution beyond a single character. Onesies, UV-reactive clothing, painted designs on fabric. The costumes were getting closer to the art that was coming — closer to the skin, closer to the body, closer to painting.

## Costumes were confidence training

The psychological insight only landed in retrospect. Costumes were confidence training.

Every time I put on a loud suit and walked onto a dancefloor, I was practising something essential: the willingness to be seen. Not just seen but stared at, pointed at, photographed, approached by strangers. That takes a kind of courage that builds slowly, one festival at a time, one wild outfit at a time. By the time I picked up UV paint in 2019, I had twenty years of practice being the centre of attention. The transition was seamless.

The bridge from wearing costumes to being the costume was the final step. The suits and onesies were armour — external identity layered on top of the person. UV paint on skin is the opposite. It transforms the person themselves. No hiding behind fabric. The art is on you, part of you, inseparable from you.

Twenty years of costumes taught me one thing that made me a better makeup artist: standing out is a skill, and once you've mastered it for yourself, you can teach others to do it. That is what I do now. I don't just paint faces — I give people permission to be the most visible person on the dancefloor. I know what that feels like because I have been doing it since 1999.

# Eighty-Six Hours to Solipse: A Solar Eclipse Festival in Zambia

The first international journey. The defining experience. Solipse — the solar eclipse festival in Zambia, 2001.

We caught a bus from Cape Town to a few hours above Lusaka — eighty-six hours from Cape Town to the endpoint. The endpoint was somewhere on the solar eclipse line where the eclipse was the longest, out in the bush. Three border crossings: South Africa into Botswana. Botswana into Zimbabwe at Livingstone. Zimbabwe into Zambia at the Chobe River.

Each border felt like passing through a portal into somewhere more real, more raw, more alive. Three weeks in the bush. One week of festival. Three and a half minutes of solar eclipse — three and a half minutes of absolute darkness in the middle of the African bush, surrounded by a thousand strangers who felt like family.

I was twenty years old, and I had no idea that those three and a half minutes would rearrange my understanding of what matters.

## Three border crossings, three portals

**The first: South Africa into Botswana.** The crossing was chaos — queues of overloaded trucks, hawkers selling cold drinks through bus windows, paperwork in triplicate. But the stamp in the passport was electric. I had never left the country before. The moment the bus pulled away from the South African side, the landscape shifted. Botswana was wide open, flat, endless. The excitement was physical — chest tight, eyes wide, everything unfamiliar and thrilling.

**The second: Botswana into Zimbabwe at Livingstone.** Victoria Falls energy filled the air before we could see the water — the mist, the roar, the sense that nature was doing something magnificent nearby. The border post was smaller, more relaxed. Zimbabwe felt different again — greener, more lush, the air heavier with moisture.

**The third: Zimbabwe into Zambia at the Chobe River.** The final crossing. A small ferry, the river wide and brown, hippos visible downstream. Zambia on the other side felt like arriving at the edge of the known world. Each country had been more raw than the last, more alive, less filtered. By the time we reached the festival site — a clearing in the bush near the solar eclipse line — we had shed layers of who we thought we were.

## Three and a half minutes

Three and a half minutes. That is how long totality lasted. Three and a half minutes that rearranged everything.

The countdown began hours before, as the moon started its slow bite out of the sun. The light changed first — not dimming like sunset, but flattening. Colours lost their warmth. Shadows sharpened to razor edges. The temperature dropped. Birds went quiet. The bush held its breath.

Then totality. The sun vanished. The sky went dark — not night-dark, but a deep, alien twilight with a 360-degree sunset glow along the horizon. Stars appeared. The solar corona blazed around the black disc of the moon — a halo of white fire, streamers of plasma reaching into space. A thousand people standing in the African bush fell absolutely silent.

Then the sound came. A roar. Not of fear but of awe — a collective release of something primal, a thousand voices erupting because the human nervous system has no other response to witnessing the cosmic machinery laid bare. People were crying. People were laughing. People were holding strangers.

Three and a half minutes. Then the diamond ring — the first bead of sunlight piercing back around the moon's edge — and the world snapped back. But I didn't snap back. Something had shifted. At twenty years old, standing in the Zambian bush, I understood for the first time that the universe is vastly larger than any plan I could make, and that the moments that matter most are the ones you cannot predict or control.

## The alchemy of extraordinary circumstances

The people we met at Solipse became lifelong friends. That is the alchemy of extraordinary circumstances — you bypass the small talk, the slow getting-to-know-you, the careful social navigation. When you have shared three weeks in the bush, a solar eclipse, and an eighty-six-hour bus ride, you arrive at a depth of connection that ordinary life takes years to build.

Some of those people are still in our lives twenty-five years later. Scattered across continents, linked by a shared memory so vivid that a single reference — "the bus", "the eclipse", "the border crossing" — brings it all flooding back. That is the power of travel as transformation, not vacation. A vacation changes your scenery. A journey changes your wiring.

The return journey was another eighty-six hours. The same bus, the same borders, the same distance. But we were different people. Barbara and I were bonded in a way that ordinary dating never achieves. We had survived something wild together, and that shared survival became the foundation of a relationship that would shape the next two decades.

I came home knowing two things I hadn't known before: that the world is generous beyond measure if you say yes to it, and that the people you meet at the edges of your comfort zone become the most important people in your life. Solipse was the first journey. It set the template for everything that followed.

# Half Colours and the 2 O'Clock Club

While the classroom was a struggle, the sports field was where I thrived. I started racing bicycles in 1994, age thirteen. My first provincial mountain bike race was in 1995. By 1997 I was representing the Western Province cross-country mountain bike team. I got my colours three years running: third in 1997, first in 1998 — Western Province champion — and third again in 1999.

Paarl Boys High called me the "2 o\'clock club" because at 2pm, when other kids stay for after-school activities, I went home to train on my bicycle. I earned half colours at school for becoming provincial champion. I even created myself a cycling portfolio to try to get sponsorship — impressive results for a kid, even if sponsorship was difficult to secure.

## When the environment matches the wiring

This was the first proof of something I didn\'t have language for yet: when the environment matches the wiring, the ADHD brain doesn\'t just function — it excels. The classroom wanted me to sit still. The mountain bike trail wanted exactly what my brain provides: intensity, endurance, total commitment, and the ability to process a hundred inputs at speed.

In Standard 9 and 10 I worked in Tyger Valley at a coffee shop on Sundays for extra cash. I spoke Afrikaans fluently — growing up in an Afrikaans town made it essential. Still speak it today.

I wasn\'t an average writer initially. With practice over my life, I\'ve become a better writer. It doesn\'t come naturally, but I\'m a good communicator — able to document what\'s in my head and get my message across clearly. That\'s probably the ADHD influence too: the thoughts move fast, and the challenge is always catching them in words before they evolve into the next idea.

## The thread that never went away

I finished matric at age seventeen. When I look back at what I\'m most proud of from that time, it\'s the cycling. Not the academic results or the social status, but the decision to pursue something I was passionate about, the discipline to train while everyone else was socialising, and the entrepreneurial spirit to build a portfolio and chase sponsorship at an age when most kids are just trying to get through school.

That thread — the self-directed, autonomous, "I\'ll figure it out myself" energy — never went away. It\'s the same thread that runs through LightSpeed, through the festival life, through the UV art practice, through the cycling pilgrimages to festivals decades later.

The bicycle was the first thing that matched the wiring. The dancefloor was the second. The paintbrush was the third. But they all share the same quality: they demand exactly what I have to give, and in return, they give me a place to be fully myself.

# Seven Thousand Kilometers Across Thailand

I travelled to Thailand for the first time in 2005. Met my friend Mel Heinz and Colin on Koh Phangan. First fell in love with island life and the place that would become my third home after Cape Town and Berlin.

We went back for Barbara\'s 40th birthday. Because we loved psytrance, we attended the island\'s parties: Black Moon, Half Moon, Ban Sabaii after-parties. Never the Full Moon Party — the psytrance parties were the draw. We also travelled north to Chiang Mai. Experienced the most incredible times.

Koh Phangan is a small but not tiny island with a mountain for hiking, amazing beaches if you\'re willing to journey to find them, coral reefs accessible by swimming — colourful fish, sea urchins, and beauty. There\'s a herbal steam bath at a temple for rest and recovery, with massage onsite. During the week I work and train, I live my best life there.

## The cycling routes deserve their own map

Thailand became the stage for some of the most ambitious cycling of my life. Over 7,000 kilometres touring on bicycle. Bangkok to Chiang Rai for a festival, then rode on the Monday to Chiang Mai. Hua Hin to Phuket: nearly 900 kilometres in six days for friend Pierre Vocat\'s wedding, then 1,100 kilometres on the return. I got saddle sores with lasting scars from that one.

People at festivals don\'t believe me that I\'m going to ride home. When they see me riding out of the festival on the Monday morning, they believe me then.

I cycled down the coast of Thailand from Hua Hin, arrived on this magical island, and something clicked. The island life, the training, the remote work between sessions — it was another environment that matched the wiring. Morning swims out to the coral reefs. Triathlon training: swim, bike, run. Muay Thai with a skilled trainer. Everything you need fits on a bicycle, and everything I needed was already there.

**Bangkok to Chiang Rai:** a festival was the destination, and the bicycle was the vehicle. After the festival ended on the Monday, I rode on to Chiang Mai — because why fly when you can pedal? The roads through northern Thailand are mountain passes, rice paddies, roadside noodle stalls, and the occasional elephant. You see the country at ten kilometres per hour instead of ten thousand feet, and the difference is everything.

**Hua Hin to Phuket:** nearly 900 kilometres in six days for Pierre Vocat\'s wedding. The coast road south is relentless — heat, humidity, headwinds, and an endless ribbon of tarmac hugging the Gulf of Thailand. I arrived at the wedding sunburned, saddle-sore, and grinning. Then the return: 1,100 kilometres back up. The saddle sores left scars that are still visible. Proudest on-the-road repair: a 14-inch tyre flat fixed with tyre sealant and sheer determination, 40 kilometres from the nearest town.

Total: over 7,000 kilometres touring Thailand by bicycle. People at festivals genuinely do not believe me when I say I cycled there. They think I mean a short ride from a nearby town. When they see me loading panniers onto the bike on Monday morning and pedalling out of the festival gates, their faces are extraordinary. That moment — the disbelief turning to respect — never gets old.

## The third home

Koh Phangan became the training base. The third home, after Cape Town and Berlin.

Morning routine: swim out to the coral reefs. Not laps in a pool — open water, salt water, fish darting beneath you, sea urchins in the rocks, the sun already hot at 7am. The swim is meditation and exercise simultaneously, the ADHD brain focused by the sensory richness of the ocean.

Muay Thai with a skilled trainer. Since 2019, with intensive seasons in 2023 and 2025. The gym on Koh Phangan is a meeting point for digital nomads, fighters, yogis, and people who have opted out of conventional life. The training is brutal and beautiful — pad work, bag work, clinching, sparring. Your body is your primary tool, and the tool needs maintenance.

Triathlon training in tropical heat: swim, bike, run. The island is small enough to lap it by bicycle in a few hours but hilly enough to challenge you. Running in 35-degree humidity is character building. The herbal steam bath at the temple afterward — recovery and meditation combined, the steam thick with eucalyptus and lemongrass, the monks moving quietly around you.

Remote work from the island completed the picture. The laptop-and-bike lifestyle: mornings for training, afternoons for LightSpeed, evenings for the dancefloor or the sunset. Koh Phangan became the third home because it offered everything I needed in one small, beautiful, slightly chaotic place. Everything you need fits on a bicycle, and everything I needed was already there.

# Wired Different: ADHD as a Superpower

Here's the thing about ADHD that nobody tells you when you're growing up in a small town in the Western Cape in the 1990s: it's not a deficit of attention. It's a surplus of it, all going in directions that school wasn't designed to handle.

I could spend six hours building a perfect model of something nobody asked for, but I couldn't sit through forty minutes of mathematics. My brain didn't reject information — it rejected boredom. Feed it something interesting and it would devour it with a focus so intense it scared my teachers.

At Paarl Junior School, there was one teacher who saw it differently. Miss Scott recognised the potential from Standard 1, then again in Standard 3, 4, and 5. She was our English and History teacher. In a school system that didn't know how to handle my brain, she was the teacher who did something different — she recognised what was there and encouraged it instead of trying to suppress it.

## Public humiliation shapes you

I was bullied because I was small. I was a bit of an outlier — friendly with everyone, had friends in different schools, but wasn't the most popular kid. One particularly painful memory: the matric kids made me stand on stage and apologise to the entire school for not knowing the inter-school songs. I still cannot remember lyrics.

That kind of public humiliation shapes you. It fed a quiet determination — a need to make others feel seen and valued. The kid who was made to feel small now makes other people feel radiant, confident, and alive under UV light. The kid who was publicly humiliated now creates moments of public celebration for others.

## Feature, not a bug

The Aquarian need to question everything, to reject convention, to see patterns others miss — amplified by an ADHD brain that moves at 200 km/h and makes connections across disciplines, cultures, and altered states. For years, this combination felt like a curse. Too weird for the normal world, too scattered for the creative one. It took me twenty years to understand that this wasn't broken. It was a feature, not a bug. I just needed to find the right operating system.

The dancefloor was the first operating system that worked. The bicycle was the second. The paintbrush was the third. All of them share the same quality: they demand exactly what ADHD provides — intensity, hyperfocus, pattern recognition, the ability to process a hundred inputs simultaneously, and the need for constant sensory richness.

The ADHD brain doesn't just cope with festival conditions — it thrives in them. Loud music, dark rooms, crowded spaces, constant movement, hundreds of sensory inputs processed simultaneously. Conditions that would overwhelm most people create the exact environment where my neurology performs best. Total flow state. Hyperfocus engaged. Hours dissolving into minutes.

Here's what I know now at forty-five: ADHD is not a handicap. It's an engine. The hyperfocus. The pattern recognition. The need to build systems to manage the chaos. The ability to context-switch between design, code, client strategy, team management, and UV art. These are features, not bugs. The world wasn't built for us. So we build our own world. And in that world, we thrive.

# Neon Revelations: The Birth of an Art Form

July 2019. A psytrance gathering somewhere in Berlin. I picked up UV-reactive face paint for the first time. Something clicked that had been building for twenty years of festival life — from the yellow Chicken Man suit, through the Cow Man era, through years of being the most visible person on every dancefloor — but never having an art form of my own.

That night, the art found me.

The evolution was clear in retrospect: dressing up, being seen, then creating. The shift from performer to artist was the final piece. Twenty years of dancefloor immersion, of understanding what makes someone light up under UV, of reading energy and crowd dynamics — all of it was preparation for picking up that first brush.

## The first strokes

The venue was a psytrance gathering somewhere deep in Berlin's industrial east, the kind of space where the concrete walls still remember the Cold War but the UV lights have turned them into something extraterrestrial. It was July 2019 — high summer, that golden stretch when Berlin barely gets dark and the city's energy is electric. The gathering had been running since the previous night. UV rigs lined the walls. Bass moved through the floor.

Someone had a box of UV face paints. I don't remember whose they were. I picked one up — a green stick — and turned to the person next to me. "Can I try something?" The first strokes were tentative. Geometric lines across the cheekbones, dots along the jawline, swirling patterns radiating outward from the eyes. When they stepped under the blacklight, something ignited. The colours that had looked muted under the dim overhead lamps now screamed with life. Their face became a mask, a portal, something other. They looked at their reflection in a phone screen and their whole expression changed.

That was the moment. Not a gradual realisation but a thunderclap. Twenty years of dancefloor immersion — the costumes, the visibility, the obsession with how bodies and light interact in dark spaces — all of it had been building to this exact point. The difference between watching art and making art is the difference between standing on the shore and diving in. I had been on the shore my entire festival life. That night, I dove.

## The technique discoveries

The technique discoveries came fast. Within the first weeks I realised I was painting ambidextrously — both hands working simultaneously, one on each side of the face. This wasn't something I trained. It was how my hands wanted to move. The ADHD brain that had always been doing three things at once had found its perfect outlet: both hemispheres engaged, mirror-image designs flowing outward from the centre.

Then came the colour behaviour revelation, the insight that separates UV art from every other form of face painting. What you see during application is not what you see under blacklight. The transformation is the art. Greens that look bland and almost military in daylight become nuclear, radioactive, alive under UV. Pinks that seem garish and aggressive in natural light become ethereal, soft, otherworldly under blacklight. Oranges that look like construction vests become solar flares. Blues that seem dark and flat become deep-sea bioluminescence.

Understanding this transformation became central to everything. I learned to paint for the reveal, not the application. Every stroke is placed knowing that the real artwork only appears when the blacklight hits. It's like composing music you won't hear until the concert hall is full — you have to trust the physics of light and pigment.

## Co-creation philosophy

I don't sketch beforehand. I don't look at Pinterest boards or follow trends. The creative process begins with a feeling — the energy of the music, the light conditions, and the vibe of the person sitting in front of me. This isn't chaos; it's trust. Trust in thousands of hours of practice, in the muscle memory of ambidextrous hands, and in the belief that the best art happens when you stop trying to control it.

The co-creation philosophy developed naturally. I don't impose a design. I listen. What does this person want to become tonight? What energy are they carrying? What colours speak to them? Then I translate. Some people want fierce geometry. Others want flowing organic shapes. Some want to disappear into the crowd with subtle accents. Others want to become a beacon. The conversation between artist and canvas is the creative act itself.

I don't just paint faces — I unlock avatars. Each person becomes the most visible version of themselves they can imagine. And I know what that feels like because I've been doing it since 1999.

## The convergence

The creative evolution in those first months was rapid. From simple dots and lines to complex geometric mandalas. From face-only designs to work that flowed down the neck, across the shoulders, along the arms — eventually full-body pieces that turned people into walking light sculptures. From painting friends who humoured me to strangers approaching at festivals, drawn by the glow of the person I had just finished.

And then the deeper realisation landed. The ADHD brain doesn't just cope with festival conditions — it thrives in them. Loud music, dark rooms, crowded spaces, constant movement, hundreds of sensory inputs processed simultaneously. Conditions that would overwhelm most people create the exact environment where my neurology performs best. Total flow state. Hyperfocus engaged. Hours dissolving into minutes. The world narrowing to the face in front of me, the brush in my hand, and the bass in my chest.

Every thread of the life story converges here. The hyperactive child who couldn't sit still became the dancefloor kid who couldn't stop moving. The dancefloor kid became the costume character who needed to be seen. The costume character became the artist who needed to create. Twenty years of preparation for a moment I never saw coming. The dancefloor gave me everything, and this was the final gift.
